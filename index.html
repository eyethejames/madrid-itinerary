      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Madrid today is a city dense with monuments, institutions, and public spaces 
        whose origins reach back to the Early Modern period, when Spain emerged as one 
        of the world’s first global empires. Although Madrid lacked the ancient pedigree 
        of cities like Rome or Paris, it was deliberately transformed into an imperial 
        capital from the sixteenth century onward. As the permanent seat of the Spanish 
        monarchy under the Habsburgs and later the Bourbons, Madrid became a political, 
        religious, financial, and intellectual center where imperial authority was asserted, 
        ritualized, and remembered. The city’s urban fabric thus offers a unique lens 
        through which to examine how empire was built and how its memory was preserved in 
        everyday space.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project approaches Madrid as a historical landscape shaped by empire, using 
        an interactive map to guide viewers through nine sites that reveal different dimensions 
        of imperial power. Rather than presenting empire as a distant or abstract phenomenon, 
        the project emphasizes how imperial history was embedded in churches, palaces, plazas, 
        scientific institutions, and centers of governance. These spaces materialized ideas of 
        royal legitimacy, religious mission, global domination, and knowledge production, making 
        empire visible and tangible within the city itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        To structure this exploration, the project is divided into three thematic pathways. 
        The first theme focuses on the foundations of imperial authority and early imperial 
        memory, especially the symbolic importance of 1492, monarchy, and religious 
        justification. The second theme examines how imperial power was sustained and commemorated 
        through  elite culture, urban planning, and financial institutions, revealing how empire 
        shapedMadrid’s civic and social life. The third theme traces networks of knowledge, science, 
        and global exchange, highlighting how information, objects, and resources from across the 
        empire flowed into the capital and were systematized there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, these themes create a connected narrative that allows Madrid to be read both 
        as a physical city and as an imperial archive. By moving through these sites, the viewer 
        is invited to reconsider familiar landmarks as products of empire and to reflect on how 
        early modern imperial power continues to shape the city’s identity today

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Viewed together, the sites presented in this project demonstrate that Madrid 
        was not merely the administrative center of the Spanish Empire, but one of its 
        most important symbolic and cultural engines. Through monuments, institutions, 
        and urban spaces, imperial authority was continuously produced, reinforced, and 
        remembered. The three thematic pathways show how empire permeated multiple aspects 
        of city life: from royal imagery and religious justification, to elite display and 
        financial power, to scientific inquiry and historical knowledge. Empire was not 
        confined to distant colonies; it was lived, curated, and normalized in the 
        metropolitan center.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first theme reveals how the origins of empire were framed through celebratory 
        narratives of monarchy, faith, and discovery. Monuments and religious spaces 
        encouraged viewers to understand imperial expansion as a moment of unity and moral 
        purpose, masking the violence and dispossession that accompanied conquest. The 
        second theme illustrates how imperial power became embedded in Madrid’s urban 
        form and elite culture, as aristocratic families, financial institutions, and 
        monumental architecture transformed the city into a stage for authority, hierarchy, 
        and continuity. The third theme shows how knowledge itself became an instrument 
        of empire, as colonial nature, objects, and histories were collected, classified, 
        and interpreted within metropolitan institutions that privileged European perspectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taken together, these sites highlight the selective nature of imperial memory. 
        While Madrid’s landscape prominently commemorates exploration, governance, and 
        intellectual achievement, it largely excludes indigenous voices and colonial 
        experiences. This absence is itself revealing, reminding us that public memory 
        is shaped by power and purpose. Empire persists not only in what is displayed, 
        but also in what is left unspoken.
      </p>
      <p>
        By encouraging viewers to move through Madrid with critical attention to its 
        imperial past, this project invites reflection on how history remains embedded 
        in urban space. Reading the city through its imperial layers allows us to better 
        understand how early modern empire shaped Madrid’s development and how its 
        legacies continue to influence national identity, memory, and public space 
        in the present.
