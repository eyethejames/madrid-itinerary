      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Madrid today is a city layered with monuments, plazas, and institutions
        whose origins stretch deep into the Early Modern period. During the rise
        of the Spanish Empire, the capital became the central stage where royal
        power, imperial ambitions, and cultural exchange were continuously
        negotiated and displayed. Many of the spaces that visitors walk through
        today — whether grand squares, religious sites, botanical gardens, or
        aristocratic palaces - carry the physical traces of this global history.
      </p>
      <p>
        This interactive map introduces three thematic pathways that make these
        connections visible. <em>Theme A</em> explores the foundations of
        imperial authority and the enduring symbols that shaped Spanish
        identity. <em>Theme B</em> highlights the material culture and elite
        memory that commemorated imperial power in everyday urban life.
        <em>Theme C</em> follows the networks of knowledge, science, and global
        exchange that animated Madrid as an intellectual capital of a vast
        empire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, these nine locations create a guided journey into how the
        Early Modern Empire was remembered, represented, and lived within the
        urban fabric of Madrid. This project invites the viewer to navigate the
        city as both a physical and historical landscape, seeing how imperial
        memory remains embedded in the spaces that continue to define Madrid
        today.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        This tour offers just a glimpse into the many ways empire is embedded in
        Madrid’s architecture and public memory. The sites across the three
        themes show how political authority, cultural expression, and scientific
        knowledge were intertwined in shaping both the city and the Spanish
        Empire. We hope this map helps you see familiar landmarks through a new
        interpretive lens — and encourages further exploration of how history
        continues to shape the spaces we inhabit today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exploring Madrid through the lens of empire reveals a city where memory
        is constantly present — sometimes monumental and explicit, other times
        quiet and woven into the everyday rhythm of urban life. These nine
        locations remind us that imperial history is not preserved only in
        archives or textbooks, but in the very spaces people inhabit, visit, and
        move through.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each theme offers a different way of reading the city: how royal
        authority was staged, how elites curated their past, and how global
        knowledge shaped the intellectual life of the capital. Taken together,
        they form a narrative of Madrid as a city shaped by its role at the
        centre of a vast, interconnected world.
      </p>
      <p>
        This map encourages visitors to continue looking beyond the surface of
        the city — to observe how places carry stories, how monuments shape
        identity, and how the legacies of empire continue to inform Madrid’s
        character today.
